# Convolutional Neural Network for binary classification
This repository holds a Jupyther Notebook where is defined a Convolutional Neural Network able to predict if a bottle image represents an open or closed bottle looking at its tap; is it corked or not?
It uses a dataset of 323 (160 open, 163 closed) images.
